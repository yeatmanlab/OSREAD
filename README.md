# User Guide:
The tasks we laid out to accomplish in our task analysis:

- Patient takes an assessment
- Patient performs an exercise
- Researcher views patient progress
- Researcher modifies assigned modules
- Researcher adds new patient
- Researcher adds new module

After additional meetings with our stakeholders, we combined the "Patient takes an assessment"
and the "Patient performs an exercise" into one task, which we will refer to as "Patient
performs a module", which serves the purpose of both previous tasks.

Additionally, the task "Researcher modified assigned modules", has been further fleshed out to
become "Researcher assigns module with individualized content".

###Patient performs a module
1. Patient logs in using the username and password assigned to them by the researcher.
    The log-in for a test user is as follows:
        Email: example2@gmail.com
        Password: password
2. The Patient chooses the module they wish to play and presses the play button.
3. Patient performs the module as directed by the module.

###Researcher views patient progress
1. Researcher logs in.
    The log-in for a test user is as follows:
        Email: example@gmail.com
        Password: password
2. The Researcher identifies the patient whose progress they wish to view and chooses the
"View Progress" button listed under that patient's name.
3. The Researcher identifies the Module and Date they wish to examine and downloads the data
file associated with those variables.

###Researcher assigns a modules with individualized content
1. Researcher logs in.
    The log-in for a test user is as follows:
        Email: example@gmail.com
        Password: password
2. The Researcher identifies the patient to whom they wish to assign a module and chooses the
"Assign Module" button listed under that patient's name.
3. The Researcher chooses the module they wish to assign from the list of modules.
4. The Researcher uploads the individualized content in a JSON file.
    The content for the test module is listed as "simple.txt".
5. The Researcher chooses the "Assign" button.
6. The Researcher can choose between two labeled buttons to assign more modules or return to
the homepage.

###Researcher adds new patient
1. Researcher logs in.
    The log-in for a test user is as follows:
        Email: example@gmail.com
        Password: password
2. The Researcher chooses the "Learners" option from the top navigation bar.
3. The Researcher enters the appropriate information about the learner into the
text boxes in the "Add a Learner" section.
4. The Researcher chooses the "Save" button.

###Researcher adds new module
This process is outlined in detail below.

# Create New Module
### 1. Pick a name for your new module
Herafter this name will be referred to as **TYPE**
### 2. Create Grails Plugin
Use the following command to have Grails generate scaffolding code for your new plugin:
```sh
$ grails create-plugin TYPE
```

### 3. Add Dependeny on MetaFunctionality
```
repositories {
    ...
    maven { url "http://dl.bintray.com/osreadplugins/plugins" }
}
```
```
dependencies {
    ...
    compile "org.grails.plugins:MetaFunctionality:0.1"
    ...
}
```

##### Note - The following classes must exist in a package named type (TYPE in all lower case)

### 4. Create Input Domain
In the domains folder create a domain class with name TYPE

This domain class must do the following:

- extend the ModuleInput class

- define the module input data as fields in the domain
- This is where you are able to define the input you want to take in when the module is assigned

Example:
```
class FirstExample extends ModuleInput {
    static hasMany = [words: String]
    List words
}
```

### 5. Create FetchInputHeadersService

In the services folder create a new service named FetchInputHeadersService.

Within this service define a method that returns a Map<String, String> that represents a mapping from the fields defined in the domain class to their respective data types.

The following data types are accepted as input:
- String
- Integer
- Double
- Boolean

or any arrays of the above types:
- [String]
- [Integer]
- [Double]
- [Boolean]

Example:
```
class FetchInputHeadersService {
    def getHeaders () {
        Map<String, String> headers = new LinkedHashMap<>()
        headers.put("words", "[String]")
        return headers
    }
}
```
### 6. Create Start Controller
Create a controller to serve as the entry point of the module.

This controller must be named TYPEController.

The controller must have a method start()

This method will be passed the moduleID of the module through params.id which can be used to get the associated Module object by calling Module.findByModuleID(params.id)

Example:
```
import firstexample.FirstExample
import metafunctionality.Module
import metafunctionality.ModuleOutput

class FirstExampleController {

    def start() {
        String inputID = Module.findByModuleId(params.id).inputID
        FirstExample input = FirstExample.findByModuleDataID(inputID)
        List<String> rc = input.words
        //Store Module in saveModuleService
        [words: words]
    }
}    
```
### 7. Save Output
At the end of the module you must save the output that you wish to pass out of the module with the Module object that was passed in.

To do so you must create a ModuleOutput object and store within it the desired headers and rows of comma-separated values.

Finally store the ModuleDataID of the ModuleOutput object in the Module object.

This ModuleOutput object will be translated into a .CSV file with the associated headers and comma-separated rows of data.

Example:
```
def submit() {
    List<String> valueRows = new ArrayList<String>()
    ModuleOutput output = new ModuleOutput()
    output.headers = ["word", "accuracy"]
    
    output.valueRows = params.data
    
    Module m = //load from saveModuleService
    if (m.outputIDs != null) {
        m.outputIDs.add(output.moduleDataID)
    } else {
        m.outputIDs = [output.moduleDataID]
    }
    output.type = "FirstExample"
    m.save(flush: true)
    output.save(flush: true)
    
    //redirect to learner home
    redirect(controller: "appforliteracy.FileOutput", action: "output", params:     [id: output.moduleDataID])
}
```

### 8. Create Views

##### 1. Create a type folder

Navigate to /grails-app/views and create a new directory called type.

##### 2. Create start.gsp

Navigate to /grails-app/views/type and create a new file called start.gsp. Edit it to have the HTML for what you want on the start page when the learner plays the module.

Example:
```
<%@ page contentType="text/html;charset=UTF-8" %>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Sample Module Input</title>
</head>

<body>
<g:form params="[modID: modID]">
    <label>Which of the following rhymes with ${word}?</label>
    <g:radioGroup name="candidates"
                  labels="${rc}"
                  values="${rc}">
        <p>${it.radio} ${it.label} </p>
    </g:radioGroup>

    <g:actionSubmit value="submit" />
</g:form>
</body>
</html>
```

##### 3. Create submit.gsp

Navigate to /grails-app/views/type and create a new file called submit.gsp. Edit it to have the HTML for what you want on the submit page when the learner finishes the module.

Example:
```
<%--
  Created by IntelliJ IDEA.
  User: josephkesting
  Date: 2/18/16
  Time: 10:54 AM
--%>

<%@ page contentType="text/html;charset=UTF-8" %>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Completed</title>
</head>

<body>
<g:form>
    <h3>Module Completed!</h3>
    <g:actionSubmit value="Log out" action="logout" />
</g:form>
</body>
</html>
```

### 9. Publish Plugin to Remote Maven Repository

Once you have completed your module you must publish it to the Maven repository.

There are several steps to do this:

##### 1. Create an account with bintray.com
##### 2. Request to join the organization osreadplugins
##### 3. Once your request is approved, add the following to your build.gradle file:
```
plugins {
    ...
    id "com.jfrog.bintray" version "1.2"
}
```

```
bintray {
    user = "username"
    key = "apikey"
    publications = ['maven']
    publish = true
    pkg {
        userOrg = 'osreadplugins'
        name = "TYPE"
        issueTrackerUrl = "https://github.com/username/TYPE/issues" 
        vcsUrl = "https://github.com/username/grails-TYPE"
        version {
            attributes = ['grails-plugin': "org.osread:TYPE"]
            name = 0.1
        }
    }
}
```

Your API Key can be found under 'Edit your profile'

##### 4. Publish your plugin
Enter the following command at your project root:
```sh
$ grails gradle bintrayUpload
```

##### 5. Verify Upload
You should now be able to navigate to https://bintray.com/osreadplugins/plugins
and see your plugin!

### 10. Add Dependencies into the OsREAD Main Application
Once you have published your plugin to the Maven repository you are now ready to integrate it into the main application!

Four things are required to do this:
##### 1. Add Dependency
Add the following line to the AppForLiteracy/build.gradle file:
```
dependencies {
    ...  
    compile "org.grails.plugins:TYPE:version" //version is specified in the build.gradle file of your plugin under the name field of version
    ...
}
```

##### 2. Add Your TYPE to ModuleListService
```
class ModuleListService {

    static List<String> getModuleNames() {
        List<String> names = new ArrayList<>()
        names.add("FirstExample")
        names.add("TYPE")

        //TODO: Add additional module names here

        return names
    }
}
```

##### 3. Add Your Type to osREAD/grails-app/init/BootStrap.groovy
```
...
import firstexample.FirstExample
import type.Type
// TODO: add more import lines for other modules
...
```

##### 4. Add Permissions to osREAD/grails-app/conf/application.groovy
```
...
grails.plugin.springsecurity.interceptUrlMap = [
 ...
 [pattern: '/firstExample/**',access: ['ROLE_USER']],
 [pattern: '/type/**',access: ['ROLE_USER']],
 // TODO: add this same line for more plugins
 ...
]
...
```

You're new module should be completely functional! Test it by assigning the module with a module input file that matches your specified input plus name and type fields.
Example:
```
{
  "type": "FirstExample",
  "name": "Example Input",
  "words": [
      "Reading",
      "is",
      "cool!"
  ]    
}
